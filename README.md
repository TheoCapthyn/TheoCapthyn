**TheoCapthyn/TheoCapthyn** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my personal brand in the Web3 space, focusing on NFT projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning blockchain development, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps).
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Web3 projects, NFT collections, and community-driven blockchain initiatives.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my technical skills in Web3 development and smart contract security.

- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Email @theodoreselina662
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Theo/He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I got into Web3 because I believe the future of ownership and creativity belongs on the blockchain. Also, Iâ€™m fascinated by how NFTs can be more than just artâ€”they can be access keys, memberships, and even digital identities!
